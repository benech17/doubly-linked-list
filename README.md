# Project C -- doubly linked list

this implementation only uses a single memory array to store all the nodes and do not use a malloc (memory allocation) for every node that is created.
As a result,this implementation is optimal in memory and time complexity.

All the project documentation is on the file subject_project_fr.pdf.

------------------

# How to use :
there is a makefile where all the commands are specified but doing just the command "$ make "  in  the parent repertory will create three executable files for the three different tests files as follows :
### homogene -> all the nodes have the same size
### random   -> very long and random sequence of adding and deletting nodes in the list
### unitaire -> test all the functions implemented,one by one.
